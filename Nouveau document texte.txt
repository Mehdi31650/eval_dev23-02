I work in IT

I'm looking for an intership in a developement company

i worked in this way for 5 years

i have never created any website directly, mobile application neither

i added new functionnalities on an existing website
            features

the customer tell us that the final version of website that we have developped for him
doesn't exactly respond to his requierements

i was connected to the company network

i don't remmber what you adviced about the drop down menu creation 

i would take the trial version to begin

i think i have understood where the problem comes 
from
